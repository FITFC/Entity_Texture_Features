# This file consists of a sequence of rules, numbered from 1.
#
# Each rule specifies a range of entity textures to use and one or more conditions
# under which to use them.
#
# The entity coordinates when it spawns (single player) or when it is first
# seen by the client (multiplayer) are checked against each rule in sequence.
# The first rule that matches wins. If no rule matches, the default texture
# (e.g. creeper.png) is used.
#
# If no ".properties" file is present for an entity, then all available textures are
# used for that type of entity.
#
# Entities with multiple textures can Optionally benefit from a ".properties" file for all texture variations e.g.
#   wolf.properties
#   wolf_tame.properties
#   wolf_angry.properties
# These entities will fall back to their default file name if a properties file for the specific variant is not present e.g.
#   "wolf_tame.png" will use "wolf.properties" if "wolf_tame.properties" doesn't exist
#
# Alternatively for "_eyes" and "_overlay" textures they will try to use the rules of the "base" texture.
#
# All property names are case-sensitive.
# All paths are relative to assets/minecraft unless otherwise stated.

# (Optional) List of weights to apply to the random choice
# Weights do not have to total 100 or any other particular value.
# The number of weights should match the number of textures
weights.<n>=<same-size list of weights>
#
# (Optional) List of biomes
# The vanilla biome names are listed here: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome#Biome_IDs
# Biomes added by mods can also be used but require "modID:biomeName", whereas vanilla biomes can be either "minecraft:plains" or just "plains".
# With ETF only, you can also use regex: iregex: pattern: and ipattern: like the Name property
biomes.<n>=<biome_list>
#
# (Optional) List of blocks
# sets the texture for the entity based on the block it spawned on or first appeared on
# this also checks the block it spawned inside allowing things like water, cave_air, flowers, etc. to be used
# Blocks added by mods can also be used but require "modID:blockName", whereas vanilla blocks can be either "minecraft:stone" or just "stone".
# as of v4.4 this property also allows comparing additional block properties as per the OptiFine spec here https://optifine.readthedocs.io/syntax.html#blocks-and-items
blocks.<n>=<block_list>

# (Optional) Height ranges
# Replaces legacy minHeight and maxHeight properties.
# Since 1.18 negative values may be specified for height. When used in a range they can be put in brackets for Optifine but will function as written for ETF.
# ETF supports:             1 2-4   -65-2  -65--2   1-4   (-65)-2  (-65)-(-2)
# Optifine supports only:   1 2-4                   1-4   (-65)-2  (-65)-(-2)

minHeight.<n>=<height>
maxHeight.<n>=<height>
#
# (Optional) Entity name
# Matches to an entities name.
# A value starting with "!" performs a negative match (not).
# Examples:
#  - Match string: "name=Pinky pinko"
#  - Match special formatting: "name=\u00a74\u00a7oPinky"
#    (for best compatibility, use the escape sequence '\u00a7' instead of "§")
#  - Wildcards using "?" and "*": "name=pattern:Pinky*"
#  - Wildcards, case insensitive: "name=ipattern:Pinky*"
#  - Java regular expressions: "name=regex:Pin(k)+y"
#    (see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
#  - Java regular expressions, case insensitive: "name=iregex:Pin(k)+y"
# Any backslashes in the match string must be doubled.
# Literal backslashes within a regular expression or wildcard must be quadrupled.
# Correct:
#   name=regex:\\d+

# (Optional) Entity teams
# ETF only!
# This is identical to the Names property behaviour however allows definition by way of scoreboard teams

# NBT (Optional)
# Select whether a mob must have matching NBT data values
# Note: this is an OptiFine feature that has not yet received official documentation,
# ETF has copied the syntax listed in https://optifine.readthedocs.io/syntax.html#nbt for now.
# NBT requires an additional value in the key this is called <nbtPath>.
# - nbtPath must match the exact name of the nbt element and is case-sensitive
# - nbtPath supports matching nested nbt elements by defining the full nbt path with '.' marking a separation
# - E.G. the Villager profession level nbtPath is "VillagerData.level" meaning the full property key would be "nbt.<n>.VillagerData.level"
# NBT can be used in several ways see this link https://optifine.readthedocs.io/syntax.html#nbt for details
# Additionally ETF adds a variation to the "raw:" syntax called "print_raw:" which will act just like "raw:" but will
# also print what that raw value is to the log for testing purposes,
# ETF also allows you to start the string with "print:" to always print the full NBT data of the entity
